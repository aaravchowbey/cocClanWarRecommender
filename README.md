## Purpose
There is no way to track who uses both of their allotted attacks in Clash of Clans clan wars. I created this project to pull the current war data from the Clash of Clans API, store it in a DynamoDB table, and provide users with insights on who is the consistently attacking in clan wars. 

## How to use
Run a clan update before you start a war to ensure that the last war's information is stored. Then you will get recommendations on who the most valuable attackers in the clan are. 

Currently not deployed publically, but I plan to host on vercel soon.
